  <h1>Results</h1>
  <p>Survival analysis was used to infer that people who had one
    Omicron infection had nine times the risk of becoming infected with
    Omicron BA.5 during the exposure period compared to those who did not
    have infections, but having two Omicron infections reduced the risk of
    future Omicron BA.5 infection.</p>
